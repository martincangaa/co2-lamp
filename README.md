# Co2 Lamp

A minimal, simple and good looking lamp, based on ESP8266 and MHz19b Co2 sensor. 

This lamp is good way to introduce yourself into the PCBs and 3d printing world, as well you build a quite decorative and cute lamp. 

### Features:
 * Co2 readings and brightness controll on App. 
 * Co2 color mode on the lamp itself (button interaction). 
 * Scheduling is an option. 

### Components and supplies

- **MHz19B**
- **esp8266 NodeMCU**
- **SK6812 RGB LED Flex-strip**
- **Touch sensor module TTP223**
- **Capacitor 10 nF**
- **LD3007ms**


### Building
The base of this was printed out of wood filament and the rest of the lamp was done with PLA (the .stl files are down in this project) 
Once you have everything printed, you'll only need to polish some of the parts with a sandpaper and it'll be done and ready to go. 
 
Then comes the electrical stuff, components which are on the list below. For the wiring you have two options:

1. Option. You can choose to use simple cables by soldering them and then slam them into the base of the lamp. (The connections for this are in a .pdf called schematic) 

2. Option. The other way to do this is to order a PCB, this is a more organized way of packaging everything and at the same time gives your project a more professional looking (To order the PCB there is .zip with all the gerber files which you will have to use to order your PCB trough sites such as jlcpcb.com "it is not an ad", you don't have to unzip it most providers require the full zip)
